      "    Using the subprocess module\n",
      "    ===========================\n",
      "    This module defines one class called Popen:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    class Popen(args, bufsize=0, executable=None,\n",
      "                stdin=None, stdout=None, stderr=None,\n",

      "                startupinfo=None, creationflags=0):\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "    Arguments are:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    args should be a string, or a sequence of program arguments.  The\n",
      "    program to execute is normally the first item in the args sequence or\n",
      "    string, but can be explicitly set by using the executable argument.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    On UNIX, with shell=False (default): In this case, the Popen class\n",
      "    uses os.execvp() to execute the child program.  args should normally\n",
      "    be a sequence.  A string will be treated as a sequence with the string\n",
      "    as the only item (the program to execute).\n",
      "    \n",
      "    On UNIX, with shell=True: If args is a string, it specifies the\n",
      "    command string to execute through the shell.  If args is a sequence,\n",
      "    the first item specifies the command string, and any additional items\n",
      "    will be treated as additional shell arguments.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    On Windows: the Popen class uses CreateProcess() to execute the child\n",
      "    program, which operates on strings.  If args is a sequence, it will be\n",
      "    converted to a string using the list2cmdline method.  Please note that\n",
      "    not all MS Windows applications interpret the command line the same\n",
      "    way: The list2cmdline is designed for applications using the same\n",
      "    rules as the MS C runtime.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    bufsize, if given, has the same meaning as the corresponding argument\n",
      "    to the built-in open() function: 0 means unbuffered, 1 means line\n",
      "    buffered, any other positive value means use a buffer of\n",
      "    (approximately) that size.  A negative bufsize means to use the system\n",
      "    default, which usually means fully buffered.  The default value for\n",

      "    \n",
      "    stdin, stdout and stderr specify the executed programs' standard\n",
      "    input, standard output and standard error file handles, respectively.\n",
      "    Valid values are PIPE, an existing file descriptor (a positive\n",
      "    integer), an existing file object, and None.  PIPE indicates that a\n",
      "    new pipe to the child should be created.  With None, no redirection\n",
      "    will occur; the child's file handles will be inherited from the\n",
      "    parent.  Additionally, stderr can be STDOUT, which indicates that the\n",
      "    stderr data from the applications should be captured into the same\n",
      "    file handle as for stdout.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    If preexec_fn is set to a callable object, this object will be called\n",
      "    in the child process just before the child is executed.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    If close_fds is true, all file descriptors except 0, 1 and 2 will be\n",
      "    closed before the child process is executed.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    if shell is true, the specified command will be executed through the\n",
      "    shell.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    If cwd is not None, the current directory will be changed to cwd\n",
      "    before the child is executed.\n",
      "    \n",
